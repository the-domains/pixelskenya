# **2015 was a year of Possibilities: ****PixelsKenya year in review.**

I know it's a clich√© but this year seems to have flown. It
has been a very big year for PixelsKenya and one that we can look back on with
pride at what we have achieved and a sense of excitement about what the future
holds.

I look forward with great anticipation to 2016 and to meeting
and working with friends and customers old and new. My advice as we start the new year is Never underestimate the power of passion, courage and talent.
With these ingredients nothing is impossible! The team at PixelsKenya - Chris, Cathy, Philip, David, Jay have proved this more than ever. 

As I look back, I am fearless about the
challenges that lay ahead for our company as I know that together we stand
strong, determined and ready to respond with conviction.

Let's stand together in 2016

_Amos Ochieng, Director_
